#summary Outlines the goals of the firemaster linux project

= Introduction =

When/if you save a password with Firefox, it saves them in a totally visible database (click 'Show Passwords,' and all your passwords are visible in plaintext).  One of the protection measures is a "master password," which means you have to type in that password to access that database.

The tool FireMaster, written in C++ by Nagareshwar Talekar, is a bruteforce/dictionary/hybrid cracking mechanism for this password, and is currently only for Windows.

= Details =

To do:
  * Port a working version (brute force only) to linux
  * Incorporate hybrid and dictionary crack
  * Write a metasploit module to grab requisite databases
  * Refine
  * Profit? :P
