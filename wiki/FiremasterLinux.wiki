#summary Outlines the goals of the firemaster linux project

= Introduction =

When/if you save a password with Firefox, it saves them in a totally visible database (click 'Show Passwords,' and all your passwords are visible in plaintext).  One of the protection measures is a "master password," which means you have to type in that password to access that database.

The tool FireMaster, written in C++ by Nagareshwar Talekar, is a bruteforce/dictionary/hybrid cracking mechanism for this password, and is currently only for Windows.

= Details =

To do:
  * Port a working version (brute force only) to linux
  * Incorporate hybrid and dictionary crack
  * Roll into Nagareshwar's FirePassword tool
  * Write a metasploit module to grab requisite databases
  * Refine
  * Profit? :P

= UPDATE 16 MAY 2010 =
  * Turns out the libraries in earlier revisions may have been dated (Thanks to Nagareshwar for pointing that out) : to remedy this, please download the latest gecko SDK at http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.9.2/sdk/xulrunner-1.9.2.en-US.linux-i686.sdk.tar.bz2
  * Make sure to modify the Makefile accordingly (point XUL_INCLUDE and XUL_LIB variables to the directory you installed gecko in)
